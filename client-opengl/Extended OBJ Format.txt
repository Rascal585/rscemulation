Extended OBJ Format (Initial rough draft)

Section I: Header
This section contains information unique to this model and uses the following keywords:
1) winding, a string value that should be either 'CW' or 'CCW' (clockwise / counterclockwise) that determines which order that the face vertices are declared in.  This affects which direction the face normals are generated from.

Section II: Tables
This format defines 3 separate tables that contain data describing various vertex elements.

In these tables, three keywords may be used to describe vertex attributes
1) v - vertex position, a series of three 32-bit floating point values (x, y, z)

2) c - color intensity, a series of three or four 32-bit floating point values
       (r, g, b, a), the alpha component may be excluded and defaults to 1.0

3) t - texture position, a series of two 32-bit floating point values (u, v)

There are three tables that may be created

1) Vertex Position Table - contains the (x, y, z) positions of vertices used in the model

2) Color Intensity Table - contains the (r, g, b, a*) intensities of the colors used in the model

3) Texture Coordinate Table - contains the (u, v) positions of the textures used in this model


Section III: Index Specification

After the tables declaration, a series of faces are created by referring to indices from each table that data should be pulled from.

The following keywords may be used in the index specification

1) f - face definition, a series of 16-bit integral indices separated by '/'
       face pulling from vertex position table only: f 1 2 3
	   face pulling from vertex position and color intensity: f 1/0 2/0 3/0
       face pulling from vertex position and texture position: f 1//0 2//0 3//0
	   face pulling from vertex position, color intensity, and texture position: f 1/0/0 2/0/0 3/0/0
	   
2) _usetexture - a 16-bit integral value specifying the ID of the texture that should be applied to the faces following it
                _usetexture 1    # use texture ID 1 on each subsequent face
				f 1//1 2//2 3//3 # draw triangle using texture ID 1
				_usetexture 0    # disable texturing

				
Section III: Example

# Extended OBJ Example

# Begin Header Section
winding CCW # interpret vertex order as counter-clockwise

# Begin Table Section
v 0 0 0
v 1 0 0
v 0 1 0
c 1 1 1 1 # white, 100% opacity
t 0 0
t 1 0
t 0 1

# Begin Index Section
 # use whatever texture is ID 1
_usetexture 1
# (vertex 1, color 1, texcoord 1), (vertex 2, color 1, texcoord 2), (vertex 3, color 1, texcoord 3)
# so in other words, a white triangle mapped to a triangle on texture '1'
f 1/1/1 2/1/2 3/1/3
